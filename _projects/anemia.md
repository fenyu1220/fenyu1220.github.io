    This figure illustrates the complete workflow of our method. The green section represents the process of extracting the conjunctiva from the original input image. The blue section corresponds to our regression model. The purple section depicts our ROI-Aware ConvNeXt model. Finally, the predictions from the regression model and the ROI-Aware ConvNeXt model are combined to produce the final output.
