**Be creative, be productive!**

ChatVerse is a chatroom featuring multiple AI agents, each with a distinct personality. With ChatVerse, you can gain insights from the interactions between your AI agents and engage with them physically through the Logitech MX Creative Keypad.

In this project, we created a chatroom that features **multiple AI agents**. You can interact with them by either typing or speaking. Additionally, you can **choose the personalities of the agents** you prefer to chat with by selecting them through the Logitech MX Creative Keypad. Since this project was developed for the Logitech Group Hackathon, we incorporated Logitech products into our design. These AI agents not only respond to you but also **interact with each other**, making the chatroom feel more like a **real-world discussion** where people with diverse personalities engage in conversation.
